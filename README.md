###  Ph.D. Research Projects

Jan 2023, [Shallow quantum circuits for efficient preparation of Slater determinants and correlated states on a quantum computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07477)<br>
Quick Summary: <br>
We designed an efficient and scalable method of preparing industrially‑relevant chemical states on quantum computers.<br>
Popular Summary: <br>
We propose an efficient, yet scalable approach to prepare fermionic ansatz states on a quantum computer for quantum chemistry and material applications.
In particular, we show how to prepare Slater determinants (a fermionic one-body product state) and correlated ansatz by applying a unique sequence of standard fermionic excitation operators to a vacuum state.
This yields a shallow quantum circuit that scales subexponentially better in two-qubit gate depth over existing approaches with the number of qubits.
Moreover, our quantum circuit is compatible on existing quantum devices with planar qubit architectures without requiring any expensive qubit swapping overheads.
Our results are particularly timely given the recent consensus that more breakthroughs are required to resolve the quantum state preparation bottleneck that prohibits a quantum advantage for large scale quantum chemistry problems. <br>

Aug 2022, [Computing Electronic Correlation Energies using Linear Depth Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03949)<br>
Quick Summary:<br>
We developed a practical methods for estimating chemical energies using currently available quantum computers.<br>
Popular Summary: <br>
We designed a new variational quantum algorithm that estimates molecular correlation energies on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. 
In particular, we generated parameterised mean-field Hartree-Fock state using shallow quantum circuits with two-qubit gate depth linear in the number of qubits and applied perturbation theory to approximate the correlation energies up to second order.
As such, we are able to capture some molecular correlation effects at equilibrium and intermediate bond distances even under the presence of quantum noise.
As quantum devices continue to improve on suppressing quantum noise, our algorithm will enable the study of larger molecules which require deeper quantum circuits.<br>
